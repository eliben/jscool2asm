* Next: implement the fixup (and proper parsing) for (new Foo)@Bar.foo(bar, baz)
* Keep writing tests going over the .asdl file: next, tests for features -
  methods and attributes. Finally after all top-level tests are done, work on
  tests for expressions.
* Write simple test discovery in test/all_tests.js and just run that from the
  makefile.
