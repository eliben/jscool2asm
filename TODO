Write an ASDL parser in Python 3.3+; it should create the same ASDL description
as the one used by Python's Parser/asdl.py; then, write a separate JS-code
generator from this description.

For COOL, the input will be cool-ast.asdl and the output will be a cool-ast.js
module that will describe the AST of cool
