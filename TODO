* Parsing simple atoms works now - strings, integers, etc. Move on to stuff
  like parsing single identifiers
* Need a way to dump ASTs - first Node Visitor use? Node visitor should be
  just written directly, not auto-generated? And tests too...
* Write simple test discovery in test/all_tests.js and just run that from the
  makefile.
